# vm-init.sh — Bootstrap script for running k3s inside a libkrun microVM.
#
# When using gvproxy networking (virtio-net), the guest gets a real eth0
# interface. This script configures it via DHCP from gvproxy (which provides
# 192.168.127.0/24 with gateway 192.168.127.1).
#
# The libkrunfw kernel does not include netfilter/iptables, so kube-proxy
# and flannel must be disabled. This is handled by the k3s flags passed
# from the CLI.
#
# This script is injected into the rootfs at extraction time and used as the
# microVM entrypoint instead of running k3s directly.

# plugin fails with "operation not supported". Instead, we install a minimal
# "noop" CNI plugin (a shell script) that assigns pod IPs from a static range
# using the host-local IPAM plugin but skips creating any bridge/veth devices.
# This is sufficient for a single-node microVM cluster where we only need:
#   - The node to report Ready
#   - Pods to start (they communicate via the API server, not directly)

# The k3s image ships CNI plugin binaries in /bin/. kubelet expects them
# in /opt/cni/bin/ by default.

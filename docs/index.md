NemoClaw is the safe, private runtime for autonomous AI agents. It provides sandboxed execution environments 
that protect your data, credentials, and infrastructure — agents run with exactly the permissions they need and 
nothing more, governed by declarative policies that prevent unauthorized file access, data exfiltration, and 
uncontrolled network activity.

## Install and Create a Sandbox

NemoClaw is designed for minimal setup with safety and privacy built in from the start. Two commands take you from zero to a running, policy-enforced sandbox.

### Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisites for the NemoClaw CLI.

- Docker must be running.
- Python 3.12+ is required.

### Install the NemoClaw CLI

```console
$ pip install nemoclaw
```

### Create Your First NemoClaw Sandbox

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Claude Code
```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox create -- claude
```

```text
✓ Runtime ready
✓ Discovered Claude credentials (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
✓ Created sandbox: keen-fox
✓ Policy loaded (4 protection layers active)

Connecting to keen-fox...
```

Claude Code works out of the box with the default policy.
:::

:::{tab-item} Community Sandbox
```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox create --from openclaw
```

The `--from` flag pulls from the [NemoClaw Community](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw-Community) catalog --- a collection of domain-specific sandbox images bundled with their own containers, policies, and skills.
:::

::::

The agent runs with filesystem, network, process, and inference protection active. Credentials stay inside the sandbox, network access follows your policy, and inference traffic remains private. A single YAML policy controls all four protection layers and is hot-reloadable on a running sandbox.

For OpenCode or Codex, see the [](get-started/tutorials/run-opencode.md) tutorial for agent-specific setup.

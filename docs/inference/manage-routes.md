# Manage Inference Routes

List, update, and delete inference routes across your cluster.

## List All Routes

```console
$ nemoclaw inference list
```

## Update a Route

Change any field on an existing route:

```console
$ nemoclaw inference update <name> --base-url https://new-backend.example.com
```

```console
$ nemoclaw inference update <name> --model-id updated-model-v2 --api-key sk-new-key
```

## Delete a Route

```console
$ nemoclaw inference delete <name>
```

Deleting a route that is referenced by running sandboxes does not interrupt those sandboxes immediately. The proxy denies future inference requests that would have matched the deleted route.

## Behavior Notes

- Routes are **cluster-level**: They are shared across all sandboxes in the cluster, not scoped to one sandbox.
- Each route maps to **one model**. Create multiple routes with the same `--routing-hint` but different `--model-id` values to expose multiple models.
- Route changes are **hot-reloadable**: Sandboxes pick up new, updated, or deleted routes without restarting.

## Next Steps

- {doc}`create-routes`: Register a new inference backend.
- {doc}`connect-sandboxes`: Connect a sandbox to inference routes through policy.
- [CLI Reference](../reference/cli.md#inference-commands): Full command specification for all inference commands.
